# About It 
Mario is a kinematically simple 5 DOF robotic arm setup that I created with the purpose of learning fundamental concepts of robotics. It got started as a design challenge for opening a toaster oven using a robotic arm. However, soon after achieving that goal, I started using MARIO as an experimental setup for inverse kinematics, forward kinematics, and trajectory generation. 
This Repository is meant to archive the code that used on this projects, MARIO. For more detailed information about this and other projects please visit my portfolio website.

# Necessary Installments
The armâ€™s rotational and linear servos are controlled with MATLAB, which easily allows for the storage and process of data, i.e. joint variables. Though, in order to access the hardware, there are a couple of libraries that have to be installed.
### Installing Dynamixel (RX-24F) SDK
